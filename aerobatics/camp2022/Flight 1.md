# Flight 1 Critique

Critiquer: Les

Loop

- Get on the Gs faster and more to keep a tighter loop.  All the way to 4-4.5Gss.
- Don't float a bit to keep from tightening up the 3rd pull
- Tight loop to keep more energy

Hammer

- Simply looked good

Roll

- Weird bit with pulling back slightly after starting the roll to speed it up

Lost the tailwheel on shutdown.  Felt like the plane was pulling left on landing.
Shutdown, turned right to point the tail for parking and the stinger broke.
